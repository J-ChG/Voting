# Voting
These directories hold code used to produce simulation results for different studies on election models.
- Elections: comparaisons of models and effects of truncation
- Borda: study of Borda and weighted variants
- Bucklin: study of Bucklin and weighted variants

The code should be seen as illustration rather than "ready to use". It essentially became a toolbox but it was never possible - or even desirable - to integrate all possible options and output formats.

Nevertheless, the computation of elections have gone several iterations and we are confident with the robustness of the core of the computations.
